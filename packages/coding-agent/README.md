# @gajae-code/coding-agent

Core implementation package for the `gjc` coding agent in the `gajae-code` monorepo.

## Memory backends

The agent supports three mutually-exclusive memory backends, selected via the `memory.backend` setting (Settings → Memory tab, or `~/.gjc/agent/config.yml`):

- `off` (default) — no memory subsystem runs.
- `local` — existing rollout-summarisation pipeline; writes `memory_summary.md` and consolidated artifacts under the agent dir.
- `hindsight` — talks to a [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io) server (Cloud or self-hosted Docker). Hindsight uses private backend lifecycle hooks to retain transcripts and recall context; compatibility-only internals remain for legacy backend calls, but GJC does not expose public coding-harness memory tools such as `retain`, `recall`, or `reflect`.

### Hindsight quickstart

1. Run a Hindsight server (Cloud or `docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight:latest`).
2. Set `memory.backend = "hindsight"` and `hindsight.apiUrl = "http://localhost:8888"` (or your Cloud URL).
3. Optional environment overrides (env wins over settings):
   - `HINDSIGHT_API_URL`, `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN` — connection
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_DYNAMIC_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_AGENT_NAME` — bank addressing
   - `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RECALL`, `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RETAIN`, `HINDSIGHT_RETAIN_MODE` — lifecycle
   - `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_BUDGET`, `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_MAX_TOKENS` — recall sizing
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_MISSION`, `HINDSIGHT_DEBUG`

Switching backends mid-session is honoured on the next system-prompt rebuild and the next `/memory` slash command. Existing users with `memories.enabled = true|false` are migrated to `memory.backend = "local"|"off"` exactly once on first launch.

## Red-claw TUI theme

The interactive TUI defaults to the bundled `red-claw` crustacean theme for dark terminals and the bundled `blue-crab` theme for light-appearance terminals, with matching welcome/icon assets. Three additional bundled migration themes — `claude-code`, `codex`, and `opencode` — mirror the look of those tools for easy eye-migration and are selectable from Settings or `/theme`. Explicit user theme settings still win; set `theme.dark: red-claw` and `theme.light: blue-crab` in `~/.gjc/agent/config.yml` to pin them.

### Welcome banner fonts on Windows Terminal

The startup logo defaults to rounded Unicode box drawing. Windows Terminal can render it correctly when the selected profile font has the needed box-drawing glyphs; recommended choices are `Cascadia Mono` or `Cascadia Mono Nerd Font`. In Windows Terminal Settings, set the profile font face to one of those fonts, or add it to the profile JSON:

```json
"font": {
  "face": "Cascadia Mono"
}
```

For terminals or fonts with broken rounded corners, set `startup.welcomeBannerMode` in `~/.gjc/agent/config.yml` to one of `unicode`, `square`, or `ascii`. `square` keeps a Unicode-looking logo using square corners (`┌ ┐ └ ┘`) while `ascii` uses only `+`, `-`, and `|`.
