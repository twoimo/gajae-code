 * incarnation fencing in generation 5, owner-lock authority in generation 6,
 * identity-atomic transition markers in generation 7, stable signaling plus
 * tri-state foreign-owner provenance in generation 8, retained managed
 * filesystem authority changes in generation 9, SDK-startup auto-reclaim of a
 * confirmed-dead owner's lock in generation 10, legacy stopped-tombstone
 * reclamation in generation 11, force-escalated SIGKILL of an unresponsive
 * older-generation owner during automatic generation-upgrade reload in
 * generation 12, restored macOS daemon signaling (kill(2) with a start-time
 * incarnation recheck, replacing the darwin no-op) in generation 13, retained
 * legacy stopped-lock reclamation in generation 14, Windows expected-identity
 * ACL verification and repair in generation 15, identity-fenced stale endpoint
 * startup recovery in generation 16, Telegram topic recovery authority fencing
 * in generation 17, fail-closed blank-token validation plus lifecycle-startup
 * stop fencing in generation 18, recommended ask metadata rendering in
 * generation 19, authoritative terminal session-close delivery and cleanup
 * fencing, attested generation-bearing pre-incarnation owner handoff in
 * generation 20, guarded modern generation-absent predecessor signaling in
 * generation 21, dead Windows v0.10 owner replacement in generation 22, and
 * retained native cleanup authority revalidation in generation 23, and typed
 * retained exact-unlink cleanup authority acceptance (concrete detached
 * quarantine plus proven canonical absence) in generation 24.
 * Generation 25 adds startup dead-root prune + leak-artifact self-heal
 * on TelegramNotificationDaemon.run (#2958). Generation 26 adds bounded reload
 * cooldown and lazy Telegram topic lifecycle safeguards (#2956, #2960, #2984).
 * Generation 27 refreshes retained native path and process authority semantics.
 * Generation 28 rejects special files before retained native authority opens.
 * Generation 29 adds serving-epoch compatibility, sidecar heartbeat, root GC,
 * and Bot API cooldown structural fixes (#2956, #2960, #3048).
